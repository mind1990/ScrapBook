<h2>Biggest Wins/Challenges</h2>

My team had only five days to build this project can we manage to make it work.

This was my first group project and we had some git conflicts which we had a hard times trying to fix.

<h2>Planned Implementation</h2>
<p>- A functional 'featured memories gallery' where new memories are cycled and featured per day from multiple users</p>
 <p>- Sign-Up form validation, password must be greater than 8 characters</p>
 <p>- Include alerts where users know that they successfully signed up, logged in, and signed out</p>
 <p>- Allow users to upload images files instead of a URL</p>
 <p>- More animations, interactions of memories page</p>
 <p>- Refactor app.js file</p>
