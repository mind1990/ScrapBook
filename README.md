<h2>Process/Approach</h2>
I wanted to build a website similar to Twitter with Facebook's color theme, so I decided to build Twitbook with the MERN Stack

<h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>
Twitbook still has some bugs such as updating user's profile, following another user and getting the liked posts to show up on a user's profile.

<h2>Biggest Wins/Challenges</h2>
<h3>Wins</h3>
I was able to build the MVP using the MERN Stack as I wanted to and implement some other teachnologies in the app.
<h3>Challenges</h3>
Since I'm more comfortable with Frant End, building a Full Stack app isn't easy for me. 

<h2>Planned Implementation</h2>
<p>- A functional 'featured memories gallery' where new memories are cycled and featured per day from multiple users</p>
 <p>- Sign-Up form validation, password must be greater than 8 characters</p>
 <p>- Include alerts where users know that they successfully signed up, logged in, and signed out</p>
 <p>- Allow users to upload images files instead of a URL</p>
 <p>- More animations, interactions of memories page</p>
 <p>- Refactor app.js file</p>
 <p>- Finalize mobile version</p>
